## Application for design GPON Network with GIS - Open Source.
This application is built using PHP and the Symfony framework and is useful for designing Fiber to the Home (FTTH) networks in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment.

The application allows users to easily plan and design FTTH networks by providing a user-friendly interface for creating and editing network elements such as fiber optic cables, distribution points, and subscriber premises. Users can also view and analyze the network in a GIS context, with the ability to display the network on a map and overlay it with other GIS data.

Key features of the application include:

Easy network design: Create and edit network elements such as fiber optic cables, distribution points, and subscriber premises with a simple and intuitive interface.

GIS integration: View and analyze the network in a GIS context, with the ability to display the network on a map and overlay it with other GIS data.

Network analysis: Analyze network performance and identify potential bottlenecks using built-in network analysis tools.

Scalability: The application is designed to handle large-scale networks with potentially thousands of network elements.

Security: The application has built-in security features to protect sensitive network data.

The application is easy to install and can be easily integrated with other GIS systems and databases. It is suitable for use by telecommunications companies, municipalities, and other organizations responsible for designing and managing FTTH networks.
